# JavaScript Mini-Arcade!

This JavaScript mini-arcade is a simple website that contains four games for the user to choose from to play. It is aimed at at an individual or individuals of any age. It contains games where the user plays by himself, plays against the computer, and a game to test two players against each other. It aims to get users to return by storing the scores and data. 

There are four games to choose from which could be either well-known, simple games like rock, paper, scissors, or classic computer games like Snake. For two players, there is a version of Connect Four where a users can take turns to try beat each other before starting a new game. Finally, there is an electronic version of the arcade game whack-a-mole which is turned into a hand-eye co-ordination game called Speed Click Test.

### Designers Goals
- I wanted to to design and deploy a neat, simple and unfussy website which would be navigable for any user of any demographic.
- I wanted to provide a small collection of simple games to users who want to challenge themselves once, twice or a few times. These games should be familiar to most people in one form or another. I wanted there to be little to no learning curve. 
- I wanted to utilize code I have written from teaching myself and from tutorials that I have learned from since I began my coding journey.
- I wanted to colour and styling to be appealing and subtle with design to be unobtrusive. 
- I wanted to give the user the option about what type of game and challenge they would like - against someone else, against the computer, or against themselves by trying to beat their previous score.
