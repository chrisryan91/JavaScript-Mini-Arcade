# JavaScript Mini-Arcade!

This JavaScript mini-arcade is a simple website that contains four games for the user to choose from to play. It is aimed at at an individual or individuals of any age. It contains games where the user plays by himself, plays against the computer, and a game to test two players against each other. It aims to get users to return by storing the scores and data. 

There are four games to choose from which could be either well-known, simple games like rock, paper, scissors, or classic computer games like Snake. For two players, there is a version of Connect Four where a users can take turns to try beat each other before starting a new game. Finally, there is an electronic version of the arcade game whack-a-mole which is turned into a hand-eye co-ordination game called Speed Click Test.

## Designers Goals
- I wanted to to design and deploy a neat, simple and unfussy website which would be navigable for any user of any demographic.
- I wanted to provide a small collection of simple games to users who want to challenge themselves once, twice or a few times. These games should be familiar to most people in one form or another. I wanted there to be little to no learning curve. 
- I wanted to utilize code I have written from teaching myself and from tutorials that I have learned from since I began my coding journey.
- I wanted to colour and styling to be appealing and subtle with design to be unobtrusive. 
- I wanted to give the user the option about what type of game and challenge they would like - against someone else, against the computer, or against themselves by trying to beat their previous score. 

## Design
### Colour Scheme

 - Colour palette from [Pastel Colour Palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/5361)

 - The colour scheme was always going to be a pastel palette. For me, pastel colours are calming. They have less contrast and brightness so what they lack in vibrance they make up for in playfulness. They are versatile and visually appealing. 
 - Pastel colours have a retro aesthetic that was common in arcades in the middle of last century. I used them here to try to recreate that arcade vibe. Pastel colours have also become trendy again in the recent decade so they are current and modern. 
 - The pastel palette is generally soothing on the eyes - and this should be effective for a website like JavaScript Mini-Arcade where the games are fairly rudimentary in design. The colour scheme needed to be unobtrusive to allow for a greater emphasis of the content. 

### Fonts

- Imported from Google Fonts, Josefin Sans is the font used throughout the entire website. It has been weighted differently according to whether it is used as a header, title or paragraph. The website has minimal text and so the website needed an elegant, easy to read font. 
- I found Josefin Sans to be elegant and versatile so it suited this project. It is easy to read so it makes a smooth reading experience. It is distinctive without being cartoonish.
- Sans Serif serves as a back-up if there is no access to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Layout 

The website has a homepage and four other pages each containing a game. 

- A homepage with a header and body element containing four divs with four links.
- Each link takes you to a separate html page dedicated to each game. 
- Like the homepage, the game pages contain the same header and body element containing the games.
