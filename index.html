                <p>Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a "V"). The game follows a set of rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. It's often used as a decision-making tool or a fun way to resolve conflicts in a fair and lighthearted manner.</p>

                <h1  id="title">Snake!</h1>
                <p>Snake is a classic video game where players control a growing snake on the screen. The snake continuously moves in a specific direction, and the player's objective is to direct the snake to eat food (often represented as dots or other small objects) scattered throughout the playing area. Each time the snake consumes the food, it grows longer. However, the player must avoid running the snake into the game's boundaries or colliding with its own tail, as doing so ends the game.</p>

The discs fall to the lowest available space within the chosen column. The objective is to be the first player to connect four of their discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game requires planning, foresight, and quick thinking to outmaneuver the opponent and create winning patterns.</p>
